In 2014 the CMS experiment at CERN released their 2010 data to the public for analysis.  As a quick exercise I decided to analyse the dimuon mass spectrum to show that this could be done in a reasonable amount of time.

<h3>Overview</h3>

The input file is the 2010 Run B comma separated values file.  The python script then produces mass spectra for same sign and opposite sign mass spectra and zooms in on the interesting regions.

<dt><em>Challenge</em>: The main challenge was that this project was made as quickly as possible.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: This project uses python and existing ROOT libraries for the maximal development speed.  The other data format available was using CMSSW and a virtual machine.  In principle using CMSSW should be straightforward, but I decided against using this because the software was already four years old and support would be minimal or non-existant, even to current CMS physicsts.
